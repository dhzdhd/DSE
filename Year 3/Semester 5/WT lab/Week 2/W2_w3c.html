    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science with support from the European Commission, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet. Since January 2023, W3C has become its own legal entity, moving to a public-interest non-profit organization after 28 years with an atypical organizational structure where legal and fiduciary roles were assumed by four host institutions across the planet: MIT (USA), ERCIM (France), Keio University (Japan), and Beihang University (China).</p>

    <h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
    <p>W3C's global standards constitute the toolkit for web solutions that scale, enabling innovators to solve hard problems, providing the proper foundations to meet requirements for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security on the web. More than 400 Members from around the world lead the development and implementation of standards. Over 12,000 developers worldwide participate in the standards development. W3C standards improve web security through the development of authentication technologies that can replace weak passwords and reduce phishing and other sophisticated cyberattacks.</p>
